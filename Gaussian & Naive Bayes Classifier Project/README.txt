Please see the PDF document in the zip folder for a summary and explanation of all my code. 

To run my code: 

 1.) load in the assignment1_data to MatLab

 2.) Open the Gaussian.m file to see the Gaussian Training and Run this file

 3.) Open the Naive_Bayes.m file to see the Naive Bayes Training and Run this file

 4.) Lastly Open and run the Testing.m file and run that to see the final results. 

Thanks,
